                      <h3> 1. The Roost </h3>
                      <hr> 
                      <p> The brand new dining facility brings a lot of potential in terms of eating experiences at SUNY New Paltz. Despite being the Underdog among dining services on campus, I always leave happy with a fresh cold bottle of seltzer. Seltzer is always bubbling and has a nice kick to it. You can never go wrong with this seltzer. </p>
                      <h3> 2. SUB West </h3>
                      <hr>
                      <p> Every day, the drink machine stands tall in the SUB West area, next to the food titans on campus, Pomodoros and Nesters. The seltzer tastes good but it can be a little flatter than the Roost's seltzer. I recommend if you get seltzer from here, do it early in the morning when there is still some seltz to the seltzer. I hope that the employees in the SUB take note of this and make sure to provide great spicy seltzer throughout the day.  </p>
                      <h3> 3. Oscars </h3>
                      <hr>
                      <p>  The bustling, crowded, and cramped establishment serves as the caterers to all the students enjoying the night life on campus. Whether it's 5:00 PM or Midnight, Oscars has you covered for all your dining needs. Seltzer in these parts is good for the most part but the machine tends to run out of many beverages and restock is slow. The seltzer is actually bubbly and spicy but it can sometimes have a warm taste here. A few ice cubes can alleviate this problem however. All in all, a good seltzer is to be had even in the chaos that is Oscars. </p>     
                      <h3> 4. SUB East </h3>
                      <hr>
                      <p> Located on the opposite side of our number 2 spot victor, the SUB East is anything but deserving of that kind of praise. The seltzer is flat and this side tends to run out of seltzer quickly. With the lower quality and the lacking taste, you might just be better off moving over to the SUB West to get your setlzer fix.  </p>                      
                      <h3> 5. Hasbrook Dining Hall </h3>
                      <hr>
                      <p> This seltzer lacks any fizz and spice to it. It also comes out very warm and ice cubes are mandatory to even enjoy it. Tastes almost like water and I would say avoid this seltzer at all costs. We all know the saying when it comes to my criticism, no spice means I won't be nice. </p>
